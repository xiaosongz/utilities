## SSD usage logger

SSD is fantstic! But do you every worry about how much Data you every wrote to SSD? 
Under normal usage, user probably won't need to worry about the lifespan of a SSD. But there are some rare cases that buggy Apps wrote excessive amount data to your SSD. It is theoretically possible that the SSD's lifespan could end much faster than expected and data could be lost too.  

Anyway, just trying to covience myself this is not a useless thing.
